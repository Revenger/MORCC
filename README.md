# MORCC
MORCC is a open source project for a Modular Open Remote Control Car which one can 3D print parts as needed.
There currently isn't a open RC project on this scale especially one that's modular.
It is designed to be a framework system where you start with a drive train crossbar and build the car up from there.
If you want different bodywork, a front or rear wing you can download and print the parts.
Want a formular type open wheel car no worries, want a truggy or a endurance style car you can do that too.

# What's currently needed:
The project is currently looking for people with skills in RC car building or just passionate people in general to help get this off the ground.

Also a webpage designer.
