# MORCC (Modular Opensource Remote Control Car)
MORCC is the open source project for a Modular Opensource Remote Control Car which one can 3D print parts and swap modules as needed.
There currently isn't an alternative open RC project on this scale especially one that's modular (you can googgle that if you don't beleive me).

MORCC is designed to be a framework system where you start with the core drive train crossbar and build the car up from there.
If you want different bodywork, a front or rear wing you can download and print the parts.
Want a formular type open wheel car no worries, want a truggy or a endurance style Hyper or GT car This is ehere MORCC accells, What if you want a open style framework buggy you can do that too MORCC can do them all.

Main website is at: [Modular Opensource Remote Control Car](https://revenger.github.io/MORCC/)
